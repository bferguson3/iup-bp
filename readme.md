# IUP 3.27 Gui template
## GCC 8.1
<br>
Makefile is for Windows.<br>
`reqs\iup` folder simply contains the contents of `iup-3.27_Win64_dllw6_lib.zip`.<br>
<br>IUP is a way easier GUI API than wxWidgets or IMGui, but less robust.
## To use:<br>
```
1. Ensure GCC is installed and targeted correctly e.g. gcc (x86_64-win32-seh-rev0) 8.1.0
2. Update paths in the make.bat file to match your system
3. Run make.bat
```
